# DiscordTTSNet
.Net 5.0 Discord Bot using Discord.NET

A custom discord bot to be used with Google Cloud's TTS. This project is meant to assist users who do not wish to speak in a voice chat; instead they can have a bot do it for them!

Also, used for my group to have some fun commands to mess with.
