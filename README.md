# DiscordTTSNet
.Net 5.0 Discord Bot using Discord.NET

A custom discord bot to be used with Google Cloud's TTS. This project is meant to assist users who do not wish to speak in a voice chat; instead they can have a bot do it for them!

Also, used for my group to have some fun commands to mess with. 

Gcloud application + key is requried to use the Cloud TTS. Copy the contents of the lib folder into the executable directory and run lavalink/run.bat. Voice commands will not work unless you have lavalink running. (For more info: https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink and https://github.com/Yucked/Victoria/)
